# SprocketToolkit
A collection of tools for the game Sprocket

**This program is in ALPHA. This means that bugs may occur.**

Latest release is [here](https://github.com/ArgoreOfficial/SprocketToolkit/releases/latest)

**For exporting, use [SprocketMeshConverter](https://github.com/ArgoreOfficial/SprocketMeshConverter)**

**The only benefit to using this is for quads and possibly faster importing time. Otherwise they are basically identical**

**reminder; add tutorial*

Features
* Wavefront (.obj) importing.
* Blueprint exporting (wip)
* Compartment Merging (wip)
