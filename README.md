**This program is in ALPHA. This means that bugs may occur.**

**For exporting, use [SprocketMeshConverter](https://github.com/ArgoreOfficial/SprocketMeshConverter)**

**The only benefit to using this is for quads and possibly faster importing time. Otherwise they are basically identical**

**reminder; add tutorial*
